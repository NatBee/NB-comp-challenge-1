# Static-comp-challenge-1

For this comp challenge, we were asked to recreate the given static comp below. We were given creative license as long as we built something that respects the integrity of the comp design. We were not provided with any assets of native files. No specific breakpoints were provided although responsiveness was required. Our creative license does not include the layout but does include copy, images, icons, and color palette-only if using a complimentary palette.

The base requirements include a basic static site setup and the site must be responsive.
